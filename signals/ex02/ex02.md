> a. On a terminal, compile and run the program
>> We need to write the .c source file, which then must be saved and compiled using the following command "gcc -g -Wall ex02.c -o ex02.o".\
After that, we can execute the binary file using "./ex02.o"

> b. Open another terminal and through the kill command send a signal that 
suspends the process that is displaying the “I Love SCOMP!” message. 
Check that the process became “stopped”. Which signal made this 
possible?

its normal execution. Check that the process left the stopped state. 
Which signal is used?
